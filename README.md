# Basketball-AI

This is the repository for a genetic algorithm controlled AI player in a basketball game. The goal of the project is to compare various generation algorithms, fitness functions, selection and mutation methods in genetic algorithms in a basketball game setting, and hopefully merge different approaches to achieve a faster learning curve that avoids local optimals more effectively. 
The basketball game is built with Unity2D, and it incorporates a large proportion of basketball game rules into it to better simulate an environment for learning basketball.
